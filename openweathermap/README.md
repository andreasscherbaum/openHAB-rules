# OpenWeatherMap

Receive weather updates


## Content

Installation of the OpenWeatherMap binding is documented here: [andreas.scherbaum.la/blog](https://andreas.scherbaum.la/blog/archives/968-Install-OpenWeatherMap-in-openHAB,-using-Ansible.html).

In addition I also developed a rule which sends tomorrow's weather forecast to our mobile phones.
