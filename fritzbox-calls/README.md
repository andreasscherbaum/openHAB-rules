# FRITZ!Box Incoming and Outgoing calls

Send notification on incoming and outgoing calls, as well as missed call number


## Description

I'm using a [FRITZ!Box](https://en.avm.de/products/fritzbox/) at home, which controls internet access and the DECT telephone.

This set of rules sends a notification if someone calls in, or someone calls out, as well as a notification if the missed call counter changes.

The FRITZ!Box setup is [explained on my blog](https://andreas.scherbaum.la/blog/archives/966-Configure-a-FRITZ!Box-in-openHAB,-using-Ansible.html).
