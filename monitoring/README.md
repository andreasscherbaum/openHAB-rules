# monitoring

All Things and many network items are monitored, in order to receive an alarm when something is not working.


## Content

The _monitoring.rules_ file shows an example of a rule which runs in periodic intervals, goes over all the monitored Things and Items, and lists what is not working. This is in addition to the alarms which are raised when something fails. Consider this a fallback to get a regular status update.
